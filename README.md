# DGA-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This repository contains a Python script which implements the dgaintel library to analyze and detect Algorithmically Generated Domains using Deep Learning

The Python script uses the **dgaintel** module to analyze and get the probability of each domain to be generated by a Domain Generation Algorithm or benign.
The module installation instructions can be found in the following website:
